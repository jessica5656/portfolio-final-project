			<p class="content-text">Quarky design student and unique candidate for hire. Comes fully equipped with a Bachelor of Art and minor in Psychology, working towards an additional associates in UX design to add to the collection. A 12 year long career as a Cosmotologist may not seem like a direct translation on the surface, but it has afforded the oppertunity to be an independent business owner, improved communicattion with clients to achive a specific vision and made keeping on beat with trends, fashion and style a priority. Have a life long love of sketching, dancing, tasty snacks, and slowly learning Spanish. Maybe one day that dream of sounding like an intellegent person in another language will come true and you'll find me on a beautiful beach in southern Spain; until then, you can catch my on my bike, listening to Hidden Brain, dreaming of my next travel destination. Could I be a future designer for your team? I hope so, I would love to hear from you!</p>
